# Governed Infrastructure-as-Code Reference System

## What This Is
This repository is a reference implementation of a governed Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) system.

It demonstrates how infrastructure changes can be made intentional, auditable, policy-constrained, and explicitly accountable to humans.

The system is designed around governance and failure containment rather than speed or local convenience, mirroring the constraints of real-world, regulated, or large-scale environments.

This is not a template for rapid experimentation; it is a model for disciplined infrastructure change.

## What This Is Not
This repository is **not**:

- A drop-in production platform
- A tutorial for learning Terraform or cloud basics
- A fast-feedback local development environment
- An opinionated “best practices” checklist
- A replacement for organizational governance or decision-making
