## What Could Be Improved

### 1. Initial Context Gathering: Could Be More Efficient 🔍

**Issue:** Spent time reviewing multiple files to understand current state

**Impact**

- Moderate - Added setup time but didn't block progress
- Could have been faster with a "quick start" guide

**Why It Happened**

- Multiple reference documents to review
- No single "current state" summary beyond templates
- Natural learning curve for first-time template use

**What We Learned**

- A "current state snapshot" file could help
- Quick reference for key metrics would be valuable
- Templates could include "where to find this info" notes

**For Next Time**

- Consider adding "QUICKSTART.md" for report creation
- Add comments in templates pointing to data sources
- Maintain a "current metrics" file that's always up-to-date

### 2. Metric Collection: Manual Process ⚙️

**Issue:** Had to manually count files and gather statistics

**Impact**

- Low - Quick to do, but not scalable
- Time-consuming if metrics need to be more detailed

**Why It Happened**

- No automated metric collection process
- Manual counting sufficient at current scale
- Tooling not prioritized in v0.1.0

**What We Learned**

- Simple scripts could automate common metrics
- GitHub API could provide some metrics automatically
- Investment in automation pays off over time

**For Next Time**

- Create scripts/metrics.sh for common statistics
- Consider GitHub Actions workflow to generate metrics
- Document metric collection process in templates
